I am an assistant instructional professor in computational social science and assistant director of the Masters in Computational Social Science at the University of Chicago. I teach learners social scientific research design, computational modeling, data science, math/statistics, and data visualization.

I enjoy working with individuals from all backgrounds interested in applying computational methods to extract knowledge and inferences from a wide-range of domains. I have training and experience in data science and policy evaluation. In addition to my academic work, I offer consulting services for organizations interested in data science, including research and analysis as well as tailored workshops teaching programming skills to your employees.
