<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am Assistant Senior Instructional Professor in Computational Social Science & the College at the University of Chicago, and Associate Director of the [Masters in Computational Social Science](https://macss.uchicago.edu). In the fall I am moving to Cornell University and joining the [Department of Information Science](https://infosci.cornell.edu/). I teach learners social scientific research design, computational modeling, data science, math/statistics, and data visualization.

I enjoy working with individuals from all backgrounds interested in applying computational methods to extract knowledge and inferences from a wide-range of domains. I have training and experience in data science and policy evaluation. In addition to my academic work, I offer consulting services for organizations interested in data science, including research and analysis as well as tailored workshops teaching programming skills to your employees.
