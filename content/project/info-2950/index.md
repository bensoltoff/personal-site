This is an applied introductory course for learners who wish to harness growing digital and computational resources. The focus of the course is on using **data** to identify patterns, evaluate the strength and significance of relationships, and generate predictions using data. These techniques are implemented using a **reproducible workflow** through the use of programming languages and version control software. Major emphasis is placed on a pragmatic understanding of core principles of programming and packaged implementations of methods. Students will learn how to use data to make effective arguments, in a way that promotes the ethical usage of data.

INFO 2950 is a required course for Information Science majors at Cornell University.
