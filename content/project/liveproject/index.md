Picture this: You're an academic researcher tasked with helping social scientists determine the U.S. government's responsiveness to public demands. A clear expression of this responsiveness is examining the types of policies legislators seek to advance. In this series of liveProjects, you'll apply machine learning to generate predictions of the policy focus of each congressional bill in a legislation dataset. Leveraging tools widely used by data scientists and academic researchers—including R, the tidymodels framework, feature engineering techniques, and ML algorithms—you'll perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to prepare for predictive modeling, preprocess the text data, develop core ML models, and train DL models.

In this liveProject series, you’ll learn to use feature engineering, machine learning workflows, and deep learning techniques to generate predictions.
